# MyProfile

I created my Portfolio from HTML and style CSS.
For the fisrt part of my Portfolio I created a head part from basic HTML and link it to CSS style sheet. 

The body part I uesd most class and some sources to build all the section in the website.

And the last part of the website is the footer with some info about me.
